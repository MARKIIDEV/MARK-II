That was a fuckin’ disaster.
<br>
<br>
&emsp; I overestimated the drills ability to stay still at one location and it either would slip off or fall completely into the hole. I tried to use one of the brackets holes that was also 16mm to use as a guide which worked, until I realized that if I were to finish the drilling job that way I would deform the chassis because of the clamps holding it down to the table.
<br>
Instead I’m just having my geometry teacher have it machined down at the local community college that has a shop.
<br>
I don’t have any doubts about it but we’ll see how it goes.
